<strong><big><u>Description:</u>üìù</big></strong><br/>
Working together as a team is a challenge when attempting to work together and coordinate a bot such as this one. "Megalodon" was created to allow those who don't feel the motivation to begin to better themselves, or do not have a starting point. These people can utilize the features of "Megalodon" not only to begin to better themselves but also to ensure to continue their journey. We hope to be able to inspire people who lack motivation for working out and give them a portal to begin.  

<strong><big>Inspiration:üí°</big></strong><br/>
Our hope for "Megalodon" was to improve the physical and mental health of those who lack the motivation to change themselves. Many people cannot go out of their way to get themselves to work out or eat healthier, and discord is an easy way to get started. "Megalodon" is not only meant to inspire one to start to better themselves, but to ensure it is consistent. Through daily workout reminders and routines, and healthy eating habits, the user can make sure they never stop their journey. Our goal is for "Megalodon" to be across all discord servers so that many people can begin to better themselves.


<strong><big>What it does:ü§î</big></strong><br/>
"Megalodon" allows users to easily calculate their BMI, BMR, maintenance calories and macros through derived formulas. The bot uses Twilio for programmable messages to send and receive daily reminders to work out and eat healthily. The bot allows the user to input whether they are losing or gaining weight, and to provide recommended meals and information accordingly. The bot also gives the user access to charts and other statistics to keep them motivated to keep working out and eating healthy. Lastly, the bot has a workout shark memes feature to keep users entertained throughout their process.

<strong><big>How we built it:ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
python, nextcord, 


<strong><big> Challenges We ran into:‚öîÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>‚öî
"Megalodon" started as multiple different mini bots made by each of the team members, and was put together into one large bot with many functionalities. A major challenge that we ran into was programming daily messages using Twilio, and messages were not being sent or received on multiple occasions. After fixing some errors, the daily reminder began to come out allowing for the problem to be fixed. Another problem was when merging the code for all the bots providing errors through incompatible types. This also was resolved through some debugging.

<strong><big>Accomplishments that we're proud of:üìö</big></strong><br/>
Developing the bot was not an easy task, especially since we integrated Twilio, we were able to develop the bot to be able to send daily workouts to the user, and with the integration of the Twilio API, send SMS messages to the user reminding them of the daily workout. Implementing Twilio was difficult At first as it was hard to store data for multiple numbers, but to add numbers to the verified list of Twilio we used a Dictionary in python to have it work. The other thing was having the daily workout system work out for set times throughout the week, and being consistent with unique workouts each day.


<strong><big>What we learned:‚úçÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
We learned how to use the NextCord API, as well as the Twilio API, and being more coherent with coding in python, as well as developing a unique idea that can become a quality discord bot for active users of the platform. We also learned how to collaboratively work on the discord bot in a short amount of time and effectively use GitHub as our repository. 

<strong><big>What's next for Megalodon:‚è≠Ô∏è</big></strong><br/>
From this point onward in the future, we plan to upgrade and change the bot to function better with more commands, and a proper built-in meal plan that would be specific to the user. We also plan to integrate The bot to hold data for multiple users, for either SMS or email responses. 

<strong><big>Where to find the project:‚úàÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
This Project can be found on our github and the devpost listing, as well as on discord in the future for people to use.

<strong><big>Targeted Audience:üë•</big></strong><br/>
The target audience is for people who are seeking alternatives to learning on how to work out,  or for new individuals that are still new to working out or creating a meal plan. People who are new to fitness can check their macronutrients and daily calorie intake, just by a simple input on discord. However, It is also useful for veterans who want quickly check their weekly or monthly progress. This combined with the access to workouts that are presented in video format allows for people to stress less about creating a plan, and can implement a workout routine on the fly, especially for those who don't have time. 

<strong><big>Functionality Requirements:‚úÖ</big></strong><br/>
The functionality of the code is based on python, with the nextCord API importation. For it to function accordingly the bot is topped off by the implementation of Twilio.
