<strong><big><u>Description:</u>üìù</big></strong><br/>
Working together as a team is a challenge when attempting to work together and coordanate a bot such as this one. "Megalodon" was created to allow those who don't feel the motivation to begin to better themselves, or do not have a starting point. These people can utalize the features of "Megalodon" to not only beign to better themselves, but also to ensure to continue their journey. We hope to be able to inspire people who lack motivation for working out and give them a portal to begin.  

<strong><big>Inspiration:üí°</big></strong><br/>
Our hope for "Megalodon" was to improve the physcial and mental health of those who lack the motivation to change themselves. Many people cannot go out of their way to get themselves to workout or eat healthier, and discord is an easy way to get started. "Megalodon" is not only meant to inspire one to start to better themselves, but to ensure it is consistant. Through daily workout reminders and routines, and healthy eating habits, the user can make sure they never stop their jounrey. Our goal is for "Megalodon" to be across all discord servers so as many people can begin to better themselves.


<strong><big>What it does:ü§î</big></strong><br/>
"Megalodon" allows users to easily calculate their BMI,BMR, maintanance calories and macros through derrived formulas. The bot uses Twilio for progammable messeges to send and receive daily reminders to workout and to eat healthily. The bot allows the user to input weather they are losing or gaining weight, and to provide reccomended meals and information accordingly. The bot also gives the user access to charts and other statstics to keep them motivated to keep working out and eating healthy. Lasty, the bot has a workout shark memes feature to keep users entertained through out their proccess.


<strong><big>How we built it:ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
python, nextcord


<strong><big> Challenges We ran into:‚öîÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>‚öî
"Megalodon" started as multple different minibots made by each of the team members, and was put together into one large bot with many functionalities. A major challenge that we ran into was progamming daily messeges using Twilio, and messeges were not being sent or received on multiple occasions. After fixing some errors, the daily reminder began to come out allowing for the problem to be fixed. Another problem was when merging the code for all the bots providing errors through uncompatible types. this was also revolved through some debugging.

<strong><big>Accomplishments that we're proud of:üìö</big></strong><br/>
Developing the bot was not an easy task, especially since we intregrated twilio, we were able to developed to bot to be able to send daily workouts to the user, and with the intergration of the Twilio API, send SMS messages to user reminding them of the daily workout. Implementing Twilio was difficult At first as it was hard to store data for multiple numbers, but in order to add numbers to the verified list of Twilio we used a Dictionary in python to have it work. The other thing was having the daily workout system work out for set times through out the week, and being consistent with unique workouts each day.


<strong><big>What we learned:‚úçÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
We learned how to use the NextCord API, as well as the Twilio API, and being more coherent with coding in python, as well as developing a unique idea that can become a quality discord bot for active users of the platform. We also learned how to colaberatly work on discord bot in a short amount of time and effectivley use Github as our repositry. 
<strong><big>What's next for Megalodon:‚è≠Ô∏è</big></strong><br/>
From this point onward for the future, we definintly plan to upgrade and change the bot to function better with more commands, and a proper build in meal plan that would be specific to the user. We also plan to integrate The bot to hold data for multiple users, for either SMS email responses. 

<strong><big>Where to find the project:‚úàÔ∏è</big></strong><br/>
This Project can be found on our github and the devpost listing, as well as on discord in the future for people to use.

<strong><big>Targeted Audience:üë•</big></strong><br/>
The target Audience is for people seeking alternatives to learning to workout, or new individuals that are still new to workining out or creating a meal plan. People new to fitness are able to check their macronutrients and the daily calorie intake, just by a simple input on discord. However, It is also useful for veterans who want quickly check their weekly or monthly progress.This conbined with the access to workouts that are presented in video format allow for people to stress less about creating a plan, and can implement a workout routine on the fly, especially for those who dont have time. 

<strong><big>Functionality Requirements:‚úÖ</big></strong><br/>
The functionality of the code is based on the basis of python, with the nextCord API importation, In order for it to function occordingly this topped off by the implementation of Twilio.
