<strong><big><u>Description:</u>📝</big></strong><br/>


<strong><big>Inspiration:💡</big></strong><br/>


<strong><big>What it does:🤔</big></strong><br/>


<strong><big>How we built it:🤷‍♂️</big></strong><br/>



<strong><big> Challenges We ran into:⚔️</big></strong><br/>⚔


<strong><big>Accomplishments that we're proud of:📚</big></strong><br/>
Developing the bot was not an easy task, especially since we intregrated twilio, we were able to developed to bot to be able to send daily workouts to the user, and with the intergration of the Twilio API, send SMS messages to user reminding them of the daily workout. Implementing Twilio was difficult At first as it was hard to store data for multiple numbers, but in order to add numbers to the verified list of Twilio we used a Dictionary in python to have it work. The other thing was having the daily workout system work out for set times through out the week, and being consistent with unique workouts each day.


<strong><big>What we learned:✍️</big></strong><br/>
We learned how to use the NextCord API, as well as the Twilio API, and being more coherent with coding in python, as well as developing a unique idea that can become a quality discord bot for active users of the platform. We also learned how to colaberatly work on discord bot in a short amount of time and effectivley use Github as our repositry. 
<strong><big>What's next for Megalodon:⏭️</big></strong><br/>
From this point onward for the future, we definintly plan to upgrade and change the bot to function better with more commands, and a proper build in meal plan that would be specific to the user. We also plan to integrate The bot to hold data for multiple users, for either SMS email responses. 

<strong><big>Where to find the project:✈️</big></strong><br/>
This Project can be found on our github and the devpost listing, as well as on discord in the future for people to use.

<strong><big>Targeted Audience:👥</big></strong><br/>
The target Audience is for people seeking alternatives to learning to workout, or new individuals that are still new to workining out or creating a meal plan. People new to fitness are able to check their macronutrients and the daily calorie intake, just by a simple input on discord. However, It is also useful for veterans who want quickly check their weekly or monthly progress.This conbined with the access to workouts that are presented in video format allow for people to stress less about creating a plan, and can implement a workout routine on the fly, especially for those who dont have time. 

<strong><big>Functionality Requirements:✅</big></strong><br/>
The functionality of the code is based on the basis of python, with the nextCord API importation, In order for it to function occordingly this topped off by the implementation of Twilio.
